_______________
UNIVERSAL CARBON REGISTRY (SINCE 11 JULY 2021) FIRST AND LARGEST VOLUNTARY CARBON REGISTRY IN INDIA
_________________
UCR issues credits under the carbon incentive model as opposed to the carbon finance model in the voluntary carbon market.  The voluntary carbon market enables private investors, governments, non-governmental organizations, and businesses to voluntarily purchase carbon offsets to offset their emissions as opposed to European Carbon Permits (called European Union Allowances-EUAs). The largest category of buyers comprises private firms that purchase carbon offsets for resale or investment.  EUAs are not backed by green projects and are issued by the EU regulators each month via auction in the primary market.  Regulated EU companies are mandated to buy EUAs or else pay a fine to the regulator (Euro 100+the current cost of the permit (EUA) currently in the market. The EUA market is not open to investors or speculators). There is no mandatory obligations in the voluntary markets.
___________________________________
The requirements set out by UCR are the same principles and methodologies under the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism Approved Methodologies and ISO 14064-2:2019.  
All climate projects must comply with the UCR Standard, UCR Program Manual and must further be verified by an independent third party UCR approved accredited certification body/auditor with GHG mitigation and carbon accounting track record, to be eligible for registration and issuance of carbon credits. 
________________________________
The Universal Carbon Registry (UCR) Standard and Platform aims to introduce better carbonomics with the next-generation model of mining voluntary non-compliance carbon credits from a wide range of green projects that is far more efficient, faster, cheaper, de-centralized in transfer and convenient for every small green project owner aiming to decarbonize the economy. The UCR CoUs are blockchain and NFT friendly.
___________________________
UCR is the first registry in the world to launch the revolutionary “Burn & Tokenize” option for holders of carbon, water and other environmental units to seamlessly create blockchain tokens by allowing the onboarding of the digital signature and the underlying environmental attribute to be taken on chain “live” thus enabling the token to be retired on the burn address of creator.

Parameter/Voluntary Carbon Market Principles

Description
_______________________
REAL, MEASURABLE AND VERIFIED
_______________
The UCR carbon credits (also called carbon offset units or CoUs), represent REAL reductions, avoidance or removals of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 and CH4) that have taken place (ex-post) from green or carbon reduction projects in India, which are currently active and operational. 
Each CoU represents a tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) (or equivalent) emissions reduced, avoided or removed from the atmosphere, from tangible activities that have actually been implemented. The reduction or removal is supported by evidence from credible monitoring and reporting and is verified by an independent third party GHG auditor. 
______________
TRANSPARENCY AND TRACEABILITY
______________
Each CoU can be tracked and traced within the UCR platform on its registry from issuance to retirement or when transferred or burnt and tokenized, allowing for a clear and transparent chain of custody.  All non confidential records are public and free to access.
______________
POSITIVE LIST ADDITIONALITY
_________________
The UCR Standard allows for CoUs to be generated from a pre-approved positive list of green projects that improves upon the UNFCCC CDM postive list of pre-approved additional project types. Further, the UCR Standard has an ineligibile list of project actvities that prohibits clean coal or fossil fuel projects from entry into the platform or generate CoUs. All UCR projects are not mandated by the Indian government or state regulator and are voluntary climate actions by project owners and developers. All CoUs purchased allow for direct climate action.  All project activities under UCR meet the “Do No Net Harm to the Environment and Society Criteria” UCR guidance requirement.
______________
NOT DOUBLE COUNTED
_________________
Only one entity (company or person) can have the legal custody of the CoUs and hence only one entity can retire/transfer or burn and tokenize the CoUs at any given time.  Ownership is determined by the physical custody of the CoUs held in the member account on the UCR (buyer or seller) platform.  Each CoU has a unique identifier as per the UCR nomenclature. Hence, there can be no double counting or double selling of the CoUs. All project developers or generators of CoUs provide an undertaking to the UCR, indicating that the CoUs will not be used for any Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for India's climate mititgation international (mandated) obligations. The undertaking is also publicly available on the UCR project database-free to view and download. Using the Burn and Tokenize option, both the digital signature and implied avoidance or reduction tonne is also assumed to be taken “on chain” thus avoiding double counting issues for blockchain token developers who aim to unlock the underlying utility at a later date for their clients. 
____________
AVOIDS LEAKAGE 
_________________
All UCR green projects reduce, avoid or remove GHG emissions within the boundary of the activity and do not increase emissions elsewhere.
